# 🎌 KANAJER! 🎌

Welcome to **KANAJER!** – your ad-free, user-friendly web app for brushing up on the basics of the Japanese language! 🚀 Whether you're on your computer, tablet, or phone, KANAJER! offers a sleek, responsive interface that’s a pleasure to use. Our minimalist design uses black and white for static elements and red and cyan for dynamic ones, creating a clear and engaging learning environment. 

With 4 levels of difficulty, KANAJER! helps you review Hiragana, Katakana, and nearly a hundred words written in Hiragana, complete with their English translations. Note: This is a practice tool, not a learning tool, so it’s best if you’ve already encountered Japanese kana before.
